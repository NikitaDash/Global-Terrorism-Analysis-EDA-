# Project Name - Global Terrorism Database Analysis
# Problem Statement:

Understanding Terrorism through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Definition of Terrorism:

Terrorism is characterized by:

"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain political, economic, religious, or social goals through fear, coercion, or intimidation."

### Major Features for Consideration:

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to comprehensively examine the dataset related to global terrorism. The primary focus areas are:

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

* Conduct essential data sanity checks on the imported dataset to ensure data integrity.
Address missing values and standardize variables for consistent analysis.
Select relevant features, eliminating any redundant or irrelevant data.
Descriptive Analysis:

* Utilize exploratory statistical analysis techniques to summarize and describe the data.
Offer an overview of global terrorism trends, highlighting trends over time, countries and regions with the highest incident rates, and distribution of attack types, targets, and casualties.
Temporal and Spatial Analysis:

* Investigate temporal patterns of terrorist activities to uncover recurring trends, seasonal variations, and specific time periods associated with increased or decreased incidents.
Apply spatial analysis techniques to visualize terrorism hotspots across different regions, identifying areas of high-risk activities.
Correlation and Feature Analysis:

* Explore potential correlations between terrorism incidents and recorded casualties.
### Visualization:

* Employ data visualization techniques, including charts, graphs, maps, and interactive dashboards, to effectively present findings.
Enhance communication of complex information in a clear and concise manner.
### Collaborative Platform:

* Utilize GitHub as a collaborative platform for individuals passionate about addressing terrorism-related challenges.
* Encourage discussions, the exchange of ideas, and collaborative analysis to foster a dynamic community of researchers, analysts, and experts dedicated to advancing our understanding of global terrorism.
The primary aim of this project is to gain insights into global terrorism, facilitate informed decision-making, and contribute to efforts aimed at countering terrorism. By conducting a thorough EDA, this initiative strives to enhance our comprehension of global terrorism trends and support a safer and more secure world.


# Business Objectives:
The primary business objective is to conduct an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Global Terrorism Dataset, covering the time period from 1970 to 2017. This EDA aims to derive valuable insights into various aspects of global terrorism. The specific objectives and insights sought through this analysis are as follows:

### 1. Terror Trend Analysis:
Identify the top 30 countries with the highest number of terror attacks. Analyze the success rates of these attacks to understand the effectiveness of terrorist activities in different regions.

## 2. Casualty Analysis:
Conduct a demographic analysis of casualties with a geographical perspective. Examine casualties caused by different terrorist groups to gain insights into their impact.

## 3. Mode of Attacks:
Perform a comprehensive analysis of the various attack types employed by terrorists. Compare different attack types used and assess their prevalence among different nationalities.

## 4. Target Analysis:
Thoroughly analyze the various types of targets chosen by terrorists. Investigate how these target choices vary by region.

## 5. Weaponry Analysis:
Conduct an in-depth analysis of the different types of weaponry used by terrorists, providing insights into the means and tools employed in these acts.

## 6. Terrorism Worldwide:
Analyze and understand the global landscape of terror attacks over the 1970-2017 period, examining geographical distribution and trends.

## 7. Terrorism at Home Analysis:
Analyze terror attacks in India, including a state-wise and city-wise breakdown. Identify the most active terrorist groups within India and analyze any significant factors contributing to these incidents.

## 8. Geo-Scatter Analysis:
Study the distribution of terrorism across the globe, focusing on the latitude and longitude of the locations of terror attacks in India.

## 9. Co-Relation Analysis:
Conduct an analysis of the top 40 worst terror attacks that occurred between 1978 and 2017. Visualize this analysis using a heatmap to identify any significant correlations or patterns among these attacks. The ultimate goal of this EDA is to provide a comprehensive and structured understanding of global terrorism trends, thereby assisting in informed decision-making, policy formulation, and academic research. By exploring and analyzing the Global Terrorism Dataset, this analysis aims to contribute to counter-terrorism efforts, enhance our knowledge of global terrorism, and promote a safer and more secure world.
